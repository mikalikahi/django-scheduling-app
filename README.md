# django-scheduling-app
A scheduling app for English teachers

This is my first Django app. I designed it to be used for scheduling English teachers and private students in Taiwan.
In addition to scheduling, the site also enables administrators to send automated messages to teachers and students
regarding scheduling times/locations and their account information. It also keeps track of the amount of instructional
hours purchased by students and the payments for teachers in different pay periods according to different pay rates.
